This is an example of CRUD app where you can add, delete, update a book to a firebase database and buy a book through the stripe API. The styling was done using tailwindcss and the whole project was build with NextJS.

Special thanks go to KOSTANTINDEV1, who is the instructor who helped me building this app during his coaching call
